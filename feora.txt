Scora na Heorste is a young Kvenscaska woman from the city of Leochte, born in
886 AF to Aevnes na Vorsca and Heorst na Mals.

Scora has straight dirty blonde hair, cut to shoulder length, occasionally
hanging haphazardly over her face. Her eyes are ocean blue, accompanied by
oft-flexed eyebrows. She has a narrow figure, and stands at 5'6". Her clothes
are a mix of hand-me-downs from her mother and mementos from her father. In
the colder months, she wears his wool longcoat, hemmed up to keep the mud
from sullying it.

On the special occasion that they had spare paper and ink in their modest
house, she would use them to draw pictures for her parents, especially
portraits of her father in his city guard uniform. She would rearrange dirt
and gravel outside into monochrome landscapes. Her mother worked as a
blacksmith's aid not long after Scora had learned to walk, and would bring
Scora to work, leaving her to play with latches and hinges not suitable for
use in building. With help from Aevnes, Scora fashioned her own toys with
scrap wood and metal. As she grew older, this fascination with the mechanical
turned to tinkering with locks, gears, and wheels.

==============================================================================

Heorst was a member of city police in Leochte, which is deep in the region of
Kvensck claimed (but not ruled) by Prulende. A number of Prule gangs were
notorious sources of difficulty, harassing Kvenscaskan citizens and making
displays of unruly protest and violent behavior, typically in market squares
and near buildings of municipal importance.

In the midst of these incidents, a group of Kvenscaskan vigilantes formed to
combat the gangs. Late night brawls became frequent affairs. Market stalls and
storefronts were frequently damaged (by malice and carelessness alike).

Leochte's police force was overwhelmed, but at one point, a handful of citizens
came to the guard station with rumors of a "demonstration" to come a few nights
later in the central market district. Armed with this knowledge, Leochte's
entire police force was tasked with patrolling then, keeping it a secret with
the hope of preventing an even greater panic.

The commotion erupted suddenly. Shouting rang out at dusk and Prule renegades
burst forth from alleys, wearing kerchiefs over their faces dyed the color of
Prulende's flag, and behind unattended market stalls. They had torches and
casks of lantern oil. Flames had already begun to wither the buildings as
policemen rushed hither and thither to fetch the fire brigade and arrest the
arsonists.

Scora had been in the market that evening, wandering aimlessly with a handful
of friends. Mere minutes before the first fires burst, Heorst had found his
daughter and urged her to go home. With reluctance, she turned homeward.

Just as she crossed the bridge from market to residential district, she heard
shouting, and looked over her shoulder to see buildings engulfed in flame. She
ran back in, calling for her father. Another policeman grabbed her as she
tried to pass and urged that she turn back. As Scora struggled to push past
him, she saw him, carrying a Prule vendor away from the furor as the masked
men cast stones and threw knives toward anyone threatening their "protest".

She pleaded with the officer blocking her way, but he did not relent.

After Heorst helped the man to safety, he turned back in to look for other
stragglers. The blaze had spread quickly. The entire street was alight. He
moved in to subdue one of the arsonists, and felled him with a swift strike
to the head with his guard's club.

Two more assailed him, striking him with fists like a four-armed monster.
Heorst staggered backwards, trying to put space between them and him, until
his back was threatened by the heat of a burning building. Beneath an awning,
he raised his arms, hoping his foes would have mercy.

But the building collapsed. The awning came down over the three of them, with
the roof following close behind. Crushed and burnt. Scora looked on in horror
and disbelief, screaming and feeling weak. The officer who was blocking her
way helped her away from the scene at last, where she sat in shock as the fire
brigade brought buckets of water and sand to quell the flames.

==============================================================================

In her grief, Scora has grown restless. On many nights, she stays out late,
carrying charcoal in her pockets and marking walls and barrels with sullen
sketches and angry words, all pointed at the masked Prules who started the
fire in the market district. Those who weren't killed on the scene were
arrested and later executed for treason. Other officers had fallen in the
fray. Several lots in the market district still lie empty from the burn.

In an alley of the burned ruins in the market district, Scora has a few bags
of sand pilfered from a fire brigade station, which she uses to practice
throwing punches on particularly difficult days. 

She writes with her heart sunken and ablaze, extinguished and erupting, all at
once. The friends that were with her that day have seldom spoken since.

Her mother still works as a blacksmith's aid, and now Scora herself works as
a courier, carrying messages and parcels across Leochte during the day, to
save money to leave Kvensck, the Prules, and the fire behind. In her time
working there, she's befriended a coworker, whose routes often cross her own,
named Achlan. On some occasions, he'll join Scora for sparring with sandbags.

She hides this goal from her mother, from whom she has grown apart. Aevnes
knows her daughter stays out late, but in grieving in her own quieter way, has
yet to confront Scora about her wee-hour arrivals and bruised hands.

==============================================================================

Scora puts up a tough front, and puts on a facade of impatience when on courier
runs to keep from getting looped into conversation. She can be abrasive and
seem thoughtless at times, but subdues the act at home or when her mother is
around, not wanting to upset her home life more than it already has been.

When she smiles, her grins range from pleasantly surprised to shit-eating.
When she's upset, a more forlorn and bitter countenance clouds over her face.
She'll take issue with people who notice and ask her, and be defensive and
angry just to push away the grief. Sympathy toward Scora will only earn her
mistrust.
